  title: "Who am I?"
  content: 
    <p class="lead">
    
    I am dedicated to investigating and addressing a wide range of 
    challenges in both the <strong>social, engineering and environmental domains.</strong> In the 
    social engineering realm, I am deeply interested in tackling issues such as 
    traffic congestion, smart cities, healthy food siting intervention, pothole 
    identification and mapping using ML/AI, crime hotspot analysis, urban heat 
    islands, and infectious disease analysis. Through these endeavors, I aim to 
    <strong>develop innovative solutions</strong> for efficient transportation, sustainable urban
    living, improved community well-being, enhanced infrastructure maintenance, 
    public safety, sustainable urban environments, and effective disease control 
    and prevention. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Simultaneously, within the environmental domain, <strong>I focus on 
    understanding and mitigating various environmental challenges.</strong> These include
    coastal erosion, forest biomass dynamics, benthic coral quantification and 
    bleaching, landslide susceptibility, and flood modeling. By studying these 
    areas, I strive to <strong>develop sustainable approaches</strong> that contribute to the 
    preservation and sustainable management of natural resources, such as 
    mitigating the impact of coastal erosion, optimizing forest management, 
    conserving coral reefs, improving landslide susceptibility assessments, and 
    developing accurate flood models for disaster preparedness and community 
    protection. <strong>Overall, my work spans both social, engineering and environmental
    spheres, aiming to make a positive impact on communities and the environment
    alike.</strong>
    </p>
